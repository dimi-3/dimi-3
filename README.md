👋  Hi There, <br>
I am Dimithri, An enthusiastic undergraduate currently specializing in the field of Financial Analytics. <br>
Learning through practice is simply what coding is for me. Python and R are the languages I work with.<br>
Below are some of the codes I’ve worked around. <br> 
Currently I am building a model for stock price prediction as my FYP. Keep in touch to make use of my final model 🙌🏻
